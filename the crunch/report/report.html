    <h1>Introduction</h1>
    <p>
      The storyline of my site involves the world of modern technology. It was
      build with the purpose to serve clients a one stop resolution to learn
      about all the current news and updates in the tech world. The structure I
      chose to implement is similar to that of many popular tech news website.
      The major structure used for my site would be the hierarchical method,
      this method is highly efficient in storing many data and cascading them
      into sub categories making it user friendly when accessing the data. It
      can be described as a top down approach where the focus is placed on the
      top of the page in my case it is where the most current and top read news
      are displayed. This helps to inform the hierarchical structure of my site.
      In my opinion this is a suitable structure for a news site as it guides
      the user in their experience with the site as they traverse from the major
      content into it's sub categories of specialized news. The site will serve
      as a mean for distributing technological news and users are able to see
      information on the latest major tech corporation, current top rating
      gadgets as well as breaking news in the world of tech and science.
    </p>
    <br />
    <p>My site consists of 6 different web pages.</p>
    <ol>
      <li>Homepage: consolidation of all the tech news topics</li>
      <li>Tech: narrowed content on tech specific news</li>
      <li>
        Reviews: narrowed content on tech gadget news review i.e. phones and
        laptops
      </li>
      <li>
        (drop down navigation through reviews page)Phones: news review on phones
      </li>
      <li>
        (drop down navigation through reviews page)Laptops: news review on
        laptops
      </li>
      <li>
        Science: narrowed content on news in the world of science and tech
        relating to healthcare and such
      </li>
    </ol>

    <h1>State 3 things that have inspired you when creating your website</h1>
    <ul>
      <li>
        One of the main inspiration of my site was a popular tech website called
        <a href="https://www.theverge.com/">The Verge</a>. As a user of their
        website, I find that their content were well organized throughout the
        site making it conveniently accesible for users like myself. Although
        there are many on going news in the tech world,
        <a href="https://www.theverge.com/">The Verge</a> was able to divide
        them into categories for users to look for and traverse within their
        targeted topics. Hence, that was the inspiration I took to create my
        site which is also aiming to achieve the same type of quality with user
        experience.
      </li>
      <br />
      <li>
        I was also inspired by the a gadget review website called
        <a href="https://mightygadget.co.uk/">Mighty Gadgets</a>. This website
        specializes in a form of tech news by carrying out their own reviews on
        the latest gadgets for users around the world to explore before
        investing in said gadget. I find such news highly relevant especially
        within our tech savvy world today, hence I decided to incorporate a tech
        review webpage within my site. This helps my webpage serve a wider
        purpose besides distributing current news events.
      </li>
      <br />
      <li>
        Also from <a href="https://mightygadget.co.uk/">Mighty Gadgets</a>, I
        enjoyed the simple yet elegant display of information on their site in
        little postcards format. I find that, that method of displaying data is
        pleasing to users allowing them to see tidy, individual packages of
        articles. Hence, I also made use of a similar method of displaying news
        articles in my Science webpage and it creates a cohesive yet tidy way of
        portraying all the different article content.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h1>State 3 ways in which you have considered usability in your site</h1>
    <ul>
      <li>
        I have ensured that my site is easy for users to traverse by organizing
        tech news in a categorized top-down approach. I made use of the specific
        relevant headers in my navigation bar ensuring that users are able to
        easily locate the specific tech news type they are looking for such as,
        general tech news, tech gadget reviews as well as general science tech
        news. I believe that in a news website, there are usually plenty of data
        that needs to be displayed hence by categorizing the articles, I can
        improve the quality of usability for my users.
      </li>
      <br />
      <li>
        Another way I have ensured the usability of my site is by ensuring that
        majority of my articles comes with an image, this allows users to
        quickly narrow down to the specific news content they were looking for.
        Most of the images also comes with an alt text within my html code such
        that users who makes use of a screen reader will also be able to
        identify the article and its said content.
      </li>
      <br />
      <li>
        Last but not least I have ensured usability by making sure that my site
        is accesible on most devices such as phones, laptops or tablets.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h1>State 3 ways in which your site is accessible</h1>
    <ul>
      <li>
        I have made my site accessible on desktop by displaying more news
        content in a structed content given the bigger screen space provided by
        computers. This way users are able to see more news articles within
        their desktop screens.
      </li>
      <li>
        I have made my site accessible on tablets as well by allowing the
        articles to be stacked under each other in a scrolling format given the
        smaller screen size compared to that of a regular desktop. This way
        users are able to access all the article content even without a laptop
        or computer.
      </li>
      <li>
        Lastly, I have also ensured that my site is accessible on mobile devices
        which is extremely important as most people currently rely on their
        mobile phones to access data due to its convenience. My site is
        accessible on a mobile phone as the navigation bar becomes a drop down
        menu allowing users to still traverse between news categories on the
        site, this allows users to access all news articles even while on the
        go.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h1>
      State 3 things you had to learn/find out by yourself and describe how you
      did that
    </h1>
    <ul>
      <li>
        I have had guidance from w3schools in allowing me to make use of
        template codes and editing them to make the code unique to my site. For
        example, the use of a horizontal navigation bar in my reviews page.
      </li>
      <li>
        I also figured out how to implement media queries into my website
        through W3Schools such that it is accessible to different platforms.
      </li>
      <li>
        I also learnt from youtube on how to effienctly insert hyperlinks on
        designated content within my site, increasing my site's efficiency as
        well as usability.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h1>What aspects of your work do you think worked well and why?</h1>
    <ul>
      <li>
        I think I managed to achieve a simple yet sufficiently educating news
        webpage such that the articles are neatly categorized and organized for
        users to access.
      </li>
      <li>
        I also think I achieved in conveying the same user experience for users
        accessing my webapge on different devices such as desktops, tablets as
        well as mobile devices. This ensures that my site is widely accessible
        for all users at any point of time.
      </li>
      <li>
        Another aspect I think worked well was by placing texts over my
        article's images, this helps to garner the user's attention by drawing
        them to the specific content of their interest. This also makes my page
        seem less heavy for users as many of the article's words are masked by
        related image in the background. Hence, users would not feel that they
        are overwhelmed by the sheer amount of text content found on a typical
        news site.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h1>
      What aspects of your work could be improved, and how might you do things
      differntly another time
    </h1>
    <ul>
      <li>
        I feel that the link pathways within my site could be improved on by
        including more sections within my page so that users all able to access
        all the content they desire just within one of the webpage.
      </li>
      <li>
        I think that my site could also be improved on by further categorizing
        each individual categories for example within my tech webpage, I could
        further categorize the tech news content and it would make my site far
        more efficient for a user's experience.
      </li>
      <li>
        I think that the media query used for my site could be improved on and
        one method would be to include more media queuries and gaining a better
        understanding of related tags.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h1>What resources were used when creating your work?</h1>
    <p>
      I have used many tech websites that I had found on google and
      understanding the best way a news article should be displayed on the site.
      This allowed me to draft out specific ways I would like to display the
      news content on my own website.
    </p>
    <p>
      I have also used many references in w3schools to create specific styling
      appearances that I would like to use in my own website.
